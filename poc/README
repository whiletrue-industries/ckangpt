Before we go ahead and implement this thing, this is a quick and dirty playground to see where we are.


Before starting - 
- `gunzip` all json files in the `poc/` directory - `$ cd poc && gunzip *.json.gz`

Responsibilities:
- `ckan.py`
  This file scrapes CKAN instances and stores simplified dataset records in a json file.
  Generally, we save all intermediate files as json files currently to avoid re-scraping, incurring extra API costs and allowing simpler collaboration.
- `embeddings.py`
  This file takes the json files and creates embedding vectors using OpenAI API.
  The result is saved to a json file as well.
