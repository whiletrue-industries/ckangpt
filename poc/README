Before we go ahead and implement this thing, this is a quick and dirty playground to see where we are.


Before starting - 
- `gunzip datasets.json.gz`
- `wget https://storage.googleapis.com/ckangpt.whiletrue.industries/poc/embeddings.pickle`
- `cp .env.sample to .env` and fill in your OpenAI API key

Responsibilities:
- `ckan.py`
  This file scrapes CKAN instances and stores simplified dataset records in a json file.
  Generally, we save all intermediate files as json files currently to avoid re-scraping, incurring extra API costs and allowing simpler collaboration.
- `embeddings.py`
  This file takes the json files and creates embedding vectors using OpenAI API.
  The result is saved to a pickle file.
- `bot.py`
  This file takes a query from the user, calculates its embedding vector and finds the closest N matches in the dataset using cosine similarity.
